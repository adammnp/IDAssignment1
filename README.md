# IDAssignment1 : Portfolio Website
This assignment is esentially a website about me (Adam), and to showcase myself in a good light. The content of the website is my biography, my skills and proficencies, my career interests, my education history as well as some of my past work.
## Design Process 
For my design process i wanted to showcase my design ability and making my website as appealing as possible while maintaining professionalism and modernity. My website is structured in such a way that every information work-related about me is clear and concise. It is sectioned into different sections so that it gives easy navigation. I also incorporated a color palette revolved around one of my favorite colors , blue.

Here are some User stories :
- As a user, i can click on the different options on the navigation bar to take me to different sections of the website.
- As a user, i can submit a contact form at the bottom to communicate with the site creator easily.
- As a user, i can see all the information by just scrolling down as its a single scroll page.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
